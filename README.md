# Customers-Clustering-of-an-E-Commerce-Website
This project consists of segmentation/clustering of customers base of an e-commerce website based on their purchase behaviors using the RFM (Recency, frequency, and monetary) marketing analysis technique. Additionally, the project provides a timeframe for updating the segmentation.

The project is divided into four sections:
~~~
1- First is the cleaning of the data.
    I started by importing the data from Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist hosted at kaggle website https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce. The Data Schema, and the definition of the variables can be found there as well.
    Then, I cleaned the data by:
    - removing not delivered purchases and purchase with missing payed amount
    - removing purchase identified as outlier in terms of payed amount, number of products purchased
    - removing customers identified as outlier in terms of number of purchases made
2- Second we do feature engineering by creating:
    - Recency (time since last order), frequency (number of purchase), and monetary (mean amount payed per purchase) for each customer
    - Delivery Time related to the mean time between the purchase date and the delivery date
    - Review Score related to the mean review score left by the customer
3- Third we analyse the selected features:
    - univariate analysis of each feature
    - bivariate analysis to check for correlation between the features
    - multivariate analysis using t-SNE for three different set/combination of features
        - standardizing the data
        - t-SNE on RFM features
        - t-SNE on RFM features with review score
        - t-SNE on RFM features with review score and delivery time
4- Fourth, clustering of the customers for three different set/combination of features using unsupervised machine learning technique:
    - standardizing the data
    - usage of unsupervised machine learning models (K-means, DBScan, or AgglomerativeHierarchicalClustering)
    - optimizing of the models parameters using silhouette coefficient, elbow curve (for K-means), Davies Bouldin score, NearestNeighbors (for DBScan), and dendrogram (for AgglomerativeHierarchicalClustering) in order to select the optimal number of clusters (for K-means and AgglomerativeHierarchicalClustering), and eps score and min_smaples (for DBScan)
    - do the procedure three times using three different set/combination of features:
        - RFM features
        - RFM features with review score
        - RFM features with review score and delivery time
5- Fifth, performing temporal stability of the clustering using the Adjusted Rand Score in order to give an estimate of updating time for the remodelisation
